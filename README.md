## Developer Workstation Installation Steps


#### Install Python and Python Virtual Env

if python virtualEnv is not already on the workstation

```

   $virtualenv --version
   

   $ sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Then once virtualenv is installed

```
   $ mkdir ~/vcademo/virtualEnvs
   $ cd ~/vcademo/virtualEnvs

   $ virtualenv mcare
   $ cd mcare
   $ source ./bin/activate
   (mcare) $
```

#### Checkout the mcare project from github

```
   $ git clone https://github.com/vmware/mcare-demo.git
```


#### Open the mcare Python Web Project 

Open the project with an editor such as sublime.
Note sublime opens the directory and treats it as a project.
File-> Open 
Browse to
/Users/bwebster/vcademo/virtualEnvs/mcare/mcare-demo/mcare-web


#### Running the Web Project locally

The project should be executed within a python virtual env
to keep python modules separate the base python install on your workstation.

Ensure the python virtual env is activated, you should see a command prompt
that includes the the virtual env name 

For example

(mcare)$ 

If is not activated then run

```
$ cd mcare
$ source ./bin/activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python runApp.py

```

Once the application has started, open a browser to the url http://localhost:5000


```

to deactivate the virtualenv at some point in the future, rather than simply
closing the terminal window, run

```
(mcare)$ deactivate
```

## Mac xcode project

Using Apple Xcode 6.1 or greater

Open the project

~/vcaDemo/pythonVirtualEnvs/mcare/mcare-demo/mcare-mobile/mcare.xcodeproj

Deploy to iphone or iphone  emulator

Use home button to go to iPhone settings.
Open mCare app and set local flask server url

For example

##### Local flask server testing:

The values should set in the config.py

  PYTHON_HOST= '192.168.0.10'
  PYTHON_PORT= '5000'

  The host value depends

Use a value of localhost if you donâ€™t need to connect from iPhone, set PYTHON_HOST to localhost and use
http://localhost:5000

Use a value of the local nic ip address if connecting from a browser and an iPhone, for example
http://192.168.0.10:5000

##### Cloud Foundry testing

If testing on Cloud Foundry install the Pivotal Cloud Foundry CLI
following the instructions at this location

[https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools)

For Cloud Foundry use the following url in the phone, no need to set PYTHON_HOST in the config.py file.
http://customer-service.23.92.225.219.xip.io


login with user  bwebster / welcome1
or another registered user created through the Web version of the App.
